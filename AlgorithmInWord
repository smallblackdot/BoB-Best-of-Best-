Generate random people positions on a 50×50 grid.

Outlier detection:

Compute distance of each person to the geometric median (or mean).

Dismiss top X% farthest people (configurable, e.g., 5–10%).

Shelter placement:

Use K-means clustering with k = num_people // 50.

Cluster people into groups.

For each cluster, compute the geometric median (minimizes average distance) → shelter location.

Output: Final shelter locations + assignments of people.
